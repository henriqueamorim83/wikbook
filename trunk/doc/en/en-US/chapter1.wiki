Wikbook is a set of tools for efficiently writing docbook documentation. For this purpose several choices have been
made that are explained below

* The Docbook system can produce high quality documents with different outputs.
* Documentation written in wiki language is a good trade off between document richness and simplicity

= Document syntax =

Wiki syntaxes are not unique, Wikbook relies on an external framework used at the hear of XWiki that is able to make
wiki syntaxes coexist. Any wiki syntax recognized by this framework can be used for documentation writing. The following
syntaxes are recognized:

* [[XWiki 1.0 and 2.0>>http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XWikiSyntax]]
* [[Creole>>http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0]]
* [[JSP Wiki>>http://www.jspwiki.org/wiki/TextFormattingRules]]
* [[Media Wiki>>http://ang.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page#The_wiki_markup]]
* [[Confluence>>http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/]]
* [[TWiki>>http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/TextFormattingFAQ]]

For the purpose of simplicity, the Wikbook documentation uses the XWiki 2.0 syntax.

Wikbook attempts to fully leverage the wiki syntax, however the horizontal rule wiki syntax is not supported. Indeed
there is no such concept in the docbook system and horizontal rule are simply ignored.

= Wiki macros =
