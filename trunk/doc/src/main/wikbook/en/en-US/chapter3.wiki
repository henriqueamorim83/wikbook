= Maven plugins =

The Maven Wikbook plugin converts wiki document to a Docbook document. In order to produce final consumable documents
(PDF, HTML), the Docbook document must be converted to new documents, this process is usually done via an XSL stylesheet
that takes the Docbook document and transforms it. The Maven jdocbook plugin is a nice integration of the XSL stylesheet
transformation with Maven. We recommand to use the Maven Wikbook and jdocbook plugin altogether.
